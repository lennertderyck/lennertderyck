### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Let me introduce my self.

My name is Lennert as you will already have noticed and I'm a student Front-end-develoment at Artevelde University College Ghent. 

I like clean design, nice illustrations and stunning photography; With a lot of passion for the profession. You  recognize my style by the generous use of white space, just enough letter spacing and a nice contrast that is created by combining fonts. I have a background in graphic design so I try to combine code and design in the best possible way.

Nowadays I focus on webdesign & -development, but my passion for print is still there. 
Tactile, tangible, analog, as only one medium can.
